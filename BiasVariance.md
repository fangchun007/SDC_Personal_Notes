# Bias Variance Dilemma

**The Gist of Bias Variance Dilemma**

A high bias machine learning algorithm is the one that practically ignores the data. It has almost no capacity to learn anything, which is so called bias. The other extreme is that the algorithm extremely perceptive to data. It can only replicate stuff that it seen before. While it will react very poorly in situations it hasn't seen before because it doesn't have the right bias to generalize to new stuff. This is extremely high variance algorithm. So in reality, what we want is something in the middle through a bias-variance trade-off. A good algorithm would have some authority to generalize. But it is still very open to listen to data. The art of playing with this balance is what make the machine learning amazing.
